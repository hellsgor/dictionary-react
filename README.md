## Running the Project

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version used during development was 20.11.0).
2. Install dependencies by running: `npm install`.
3. Start the project in development mode with: `npm run dev`. This will start a local development server. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to see the result.
4. To build the project for production, run: `npm run build`. The built files will be located in the `/dist` directory.
5. To preview the built project, use: `npm run preview`. This will start a local server for previewing the built project.
